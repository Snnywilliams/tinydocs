A few weeks ago I was speaking with a dear friend and mentor about Tiny Docs. His rabid enthusiasm about Tiny Docs and our mission moves even me. We talked about its potential to positively affect change in the world and potential stumbles and pitfalls that we could face. At the end of the conversation, he told me that if we executed we could be in a position of getting a billion users. I looked at him with a knowing smile and responded that our goal was not a billion users. He gave me a puzzled look. "Why not?" he responded. I said that our goal was not a billion smiles. No. Our goal is a billion smiles--a billion smiles in dozens of languages. And so a billion smiles is our benchmark for success : )
