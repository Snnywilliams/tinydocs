When a child faces a health challenge, it affects not only the child, but the entire family. I have spoken with plenty of families to know that a parent or guardian feels every square inch of fear and anxiety that a child feels. I've consoled parents as I have listened to their heart wrenching stories of trying to find resources to help their kids understand their health challenge. At the end of the day, families sought relief. And sadly they weren't able to find anything aside from the pamphlets that they picked up in reception. And there were few resources on the internet. 

Our animation is intended to fill the void. We hope that our library of animated shorts inform and ultimately empower kids with feeling that they can overcome their health challenge. That's why we do what we do.
