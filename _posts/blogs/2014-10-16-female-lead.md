title: A Remarkable Female Lead
tags : [intro, beginner, jekyll, tutorial]

One of the first things that people notice when I show them our cast of characters is that our lead character is a young lady with purple hair. The surprise stems more from the choice of a female lead and has less do to do with the purple hair. Sadly, a female lead is still remarkable--worth remarking about. When I first started dreaming of Tiny Docs, I knew that the lead must be a little girl. As a feminist, it saddens me that gender inequality exists as well as obstinate, backwards thoughts about women still exist. I wanted to do something to flip the script, but as a man with very little influence, I felt like there was little I could do. So, I created these characters to try to affect a bit of change. 

Dr. Patches was created on a long road trip from Chicago to Fairborn, Ohio with my girlfriend, Angela. She helped me iron out the details and she was instrumental in helping me develop the character during out 12 hour roundtrip. 

We are not only trying to impact the healthcare space, but also greater society. Not only do we hope to educate kids and families about health, we also aim to inspire the next generation of doctors and nurses and undermine dated stereotypes of roles. We look forward to the day when having a female doctor is no longer something that is work remarking about.
